In this project I had to write an application what makes different tests to make sure that the application will run error free.

During the project I had to use [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) framework to develop the program.

## How to run

* Clone - simple use git clone to copy the repository to your machine and start the application with the index.html file

* Download - download the zip, extract it in the desired folder and start with the index.html file
